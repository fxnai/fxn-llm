Use local LLMs in your Python apps, with GPU acceleration and zero dependencies. This package is designed to patch `OpenAI` and `Anthropic` clients for running inference locally, using predictors hosted on [Function](https://fxn.ai/explore).

> [!TIP]
> We offer a similar package for use in the browser and Node.js. Check out [fxn-llm-js](https://github.com/fxnai/fxn-llm-js).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package is still a work-in-progress, so the API could change drastically between **all** releases.

## Installing Function LLM
Function is distributed on PyPi. To install, open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
# Install Function LLM
$ pip install --upgrade fxn-llm
```

> [!NOTE]
> Function LLM requires Python 3.10+

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to create an access key by signing onto [Function](https://fxn.ai/settings/developer). You'll need it to fetch the predictor at runtime.

## Using the OpenAI Client Locally
To run text generation and embedding models locally using the OpenAI client, patch your `OpenAI` instance with the `locally` function:
```py
from openai import OpenAI
from fxn_llm import locally

# ðŸ’¥ Create your OpenAI client
openai = OpenAI()

# ðŸ”¥ Make it local
openai = locally(openai)

# ðŸš€ Generate embeddings
embeddings = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="@nomic/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-quant",
    input="search_query: Hello world!"
)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, only `openai.embeddings.create` is supported. Text generation is coming soon!
